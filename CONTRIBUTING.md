# Contributing to list

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the awesome production machine learning list!

## Considerations

The key things to bare in mind when contributing a new list are the following:

* This is not an exhaustive listing
* Repository should ideally be at least six months old and actively maintained
* Project should ideally have 100+ stars
* All contributions must be done in alphabetical order relative to the section
* The library should not be repeated across more than one section
* In order to propose a new section, please add an issue first for discussion
* In order to add a new section at least 5-10 (the more the more likely) new tools have to be identified and clear separation of a sub-area has to be made as a case
    * To increase changes please open an issue to discuss adding a new section first to avoid a chance of changes rejected

## Decision Making Process

This principle of "disagree and commit" from a maintainer's perspective is used as the decision making framework to add contributions.

This is necessary due to the active contributions which require an efficient decision process to avoid a [3 line PRs resulting in a discussion 10x longer](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning/pull/379).

We use the following decision process to review PRs/issues:

* When a PR or issue is created feedback will be provided
* Decision will be provided (which may not be perfect but required to move ahead)
* Discussions that go beyond a few back-and-forths will result in changes rejected and PR/issues closed
