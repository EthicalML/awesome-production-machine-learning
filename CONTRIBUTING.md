# Key Considerations

When proposing a new tool or section, please keep the following in mind:

* This list is meant to highlight notable tools, not to be an exhaustive directory.
* Tools should have a minimum of 100 stars on GitHub.
* Tools should not be listed in more than one section.
* Tools should not be archived and must have been actively maintained within the last 6 months.
* Ensure that all contributions are listed in alphabetical order within their respective sections.
* Before adding a new section, please open an issue for discussion. A new section will only be considered if at least 10 new tools can be identified, demonstrating a clear need for the sub-area.

# Review Process

Initial Feedback: When a pull request (PR) or issue is created, initial feedback will be provided by the maintainers.
Decision: A decision will be made based on the feedback. The decision might not be perfect, but it is necessary to move forward.
Limited Discussions: If discussions become prolonged or extend beyond a few exchanges, the proposed changes may be rejected, and the PR or issue will be closed.
